Surge is a tiny, ultra-lightweight JavaScript library that adds a surge of reactivity to your HTML ‚Äî all in just 1kb (minified and gzipped).

Look how simple a basic counter is - just add a data-action and data-reaction for instant reactivity!

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button data-action="count++">Count</button>
  <h1 data-reaction="count">0</h1>
</main>
```

Surge embraces the simplicity of the web and the power of HTML-first development. It supercharges your HTML with a sprinkle of declarative magic using `data-*` attributes ‚Äî no JSX, no build step and no dependencies. Just clean, semantic HTML ‚Äî with a surge of reactivity!

## Another Example

Write some HTML ...

```html
<div data-surge>
  <input id="name" type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
  <button data-action="click -> greet">Greet</button>
  <h1>Hello <strong data-reaction="output">World</strong></h1>
</div>
```

... then register the named action in the JS:

```javascript
surge(actions: {
    greet: $ => $.output = $("#name").value
})
```

The `$` is the Surge object, it's like a next-gen jQuery that can also manage reactive state!

‚ö°Ô∏è Action binding with parameters ‚Äî Easily wire logic to events like click, input, or submit

‚ö°Ô∏è Reactive HTML insertion ‚Äî Dynamically add content and Surge wires it up automatically

‚ö°Ô∏è Two-way binding ‚Äî Update your data or your UI, and both stay in sync

‚ö°Ô∏è LocalStorage support ‚Äî Persist state with zero config


Surge is built with simplicity in mind and works with the browser. HTML is the templating language and vanilla JS is the programming language. Surge  is so small you won't notice it's there, it gets out of your way to let you build, whether you‚Äôre prototyping, enhancing a static site, or building a micro-app.


Surge was inspired by the brilliant [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev) library.

# Usage

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Actions & Reactions

At the heart of surge are *actions* and *reactions*.

Add a `data-action` attribute to an element to tell it what action you want to run when a particular event happens. For example this will add a click event to a button that will then call the `increment` action:

```javascript
<button data-action="click->increment">Count</button>
```

You actually don't need to specify the event in most cases because Surge will use the default event or elements, so this will also call the `increment` action when the button is clicked because 'click' is the default event for buttons:

```javascript
<button data-action="increment">Count</button>
```

The default actions for elements are summarised below:

* FORM: "submit"
* INPUT: "input"
* TEXTAREA: "input"
* SELECT: "change"
* All other elements: "click"

Reactions make elements reactive - their text content instantly updates when the value they are bound to changes.

To bind an element to a value, simple add a `data-reaction` attribute:

```javascript
  <h1 data-reaction="count">0</h1>
```

The text content of this h1 element is now boud to the `count` property of the Surge object that gets passed to all actions. The `count` property also gets an initial value of `0` since that is the initial text content.

Last of all, we just need to write the increment function that wires together the action and reaction data-attributes:

```javascript
const increment = surge => surge.count++
```

All actions accept the Surge object as their first parameter. A common practice is to use `$` to represent the Surge object (Let us not forget jQuery!):

```javascript
const increment = $ => $.count++
```

Any changes to `$.count` inside an action will instantly update the text content of any element that has a `data-reaction="count"` attribute.

This means that pressing the button will make the value inside the h1 increase by 1 on each click.

To get it working, an object of all the actions just needs passing to the Surge function:

```javascript
const actions = { increment }
surge(actions)
```

For simple, one-line actions, you can just write them inline like this:

```javascript
<button data-action="$.count++">Count</button>
```

This means that you don't need to write any JavaScript at all, just call the surge function:

```javascript
surge()
```

## Installation

Either use npm or yarn to install:

```
npm install @daz4126/surge
```

Then import the `surge` function in your JavaScript file:

```
import surge from "@daz4126/surge"
```

Alternatively you can just import from a CDN:

```
import surge from "https://esm.sh/@daz4126/surge"
```

## Usage

Surge works by adding `data` attributes to your HTML.

Let's look at a simple example to illustrate how it works.

We'll make a little counter app that tracks how many times a button has been pressed.

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button>Pressed <span>0</span> times</button>
</main>
```

First, we need to add a `data-surge` attribute to the container element to identify that we're using Surge:

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button>Pressed <span>0</span> times</button>
</main>
```

Next we need to add a `data-action` attribute to the button. This tells Surge what action to run when the button is pressed. These take the form of `data-action="event->actionName"`:

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button data-action="click->increment">Pressed <span>0</span> times</button>
</main>
```

This means that when the button is clicked the action called `increment` will be called.

Buttons have a default event of 'click', so we can omit the reference to it and just write the name of the action:

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button data-action="increment">Pressed <span>0</span> times</button>
</main>
```

Next we need to associate the value of the count with the `span` element inside the button. To do this we give it a `data-reaction` attribute of "count". Surge uses this to identify the element. This element will also be reactive and it's text content will update dynamically whenever its property is changed inside a surge action. We assign an initial value of `0` by setting the text content to `0`:

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button data-action="increment">Pressed <span data-reaction="count">0</span> times</button>
</main>
```

This will add a `count` property to the Surge object, which is the argument of any Surge actions. Changing the value of this propetry will cause the text content to automatically update and re-render.

Now we just need to define our `increment` action in the JavaScript. Actions are similar to event handlers and are passed to the `surge` function as an object:

```javascript
surge({
    increment: ($,e) => $.count++
})
```
Surge actions have two parameters - the *Surge object*, `$`, and the event object, `e`. The event object is exactly the same as any event handler and the Surge object has some methods that can be used to access and update the elements that have been marked with an `data-element` and `data-value` attributes. In the example above `$.count` refers to the value contained in the span element that has the `data-value` attribute and can be treated just like a normal JavaScript variable, so using the increment operator, `++`, will increase its value by 1. Any changes will automatically update the text content of the element with the new value, so every time the button is pressed, the next number will be displayed.

Note that in the example above, we don't actually use the event object, so we can omit it from the action definition:

```javascript
surge({
    increment: $ => $.count++
})
```

We can make actions more generic by adding parameters to them. These are added inside parentheses inside the `data-action` value

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button data-action="increment(1)">Increase by 1</button>
  <button data-action="increment(2)">Increase by 2</button>
  <h1 data-value="count">0</h1>
</main>
```

Actions that accept parameters need to have an extra parameter added to the function using a curried form of 'double arrow function', for example, we can add the parameter `n` which represents the amount to increment by to the `increment` action like this:

```javascript
surge({
    increment: n => $ => $.count += n
})
```

This will now pass the parameter from the action into the function and increment the value of `count` by this amount.

We can set a default value of `1` in the usual way:

```javascript
surge({
    increment: (n=1) => $ => $.count += n
})
```

Note that the parentheses are still required in the `data-action` value to indicate that this is an action that accepts parentheses:

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button data-action="increment()">Increase by 1</button>
  <button data-action="increment(2)">Increase by 2</button>
  <h1 data-value="count">0</h1>
</main>
```

This example can be seen [on CodePen](https://codepen.io/daz4126/pen/dyLLpwy).

### Data Attributes

#### `data-surge`

Signifies the start of a Surge block of code, any Surge code will only apply to anything inside this container.

#### `data-value`

Used to create reactive values.

#### `data-action`
#### `data-calculate`
#### `data-bind`
#### `data-default`
#### `data-foo`

### The `init` action

The `init` action will run once after the HTML loads. This is useful for any setup code that needs running.

The `init` action is **not** an event listener so only accepts the Surge object as it's only argument, for example:

```javascript
init: $ => {
  console.log("Surge has started ...")
}
```

## Accessing Elements

Elements can be accessed using jQuery-style syntax and query selectors.

## Creating Dynamic Content

Elements that have been added to the Surge object have a number of methods that can be used to add dynamic content. Any content added can also use the 

### `$(selector).append`

Every element that can be accessed using the Surge object has an `append` method that can be used to append HTML to it. The dynamically added HTML fragment is provided as a string and becomes the last child of the element. For example the following code would append a list item to a list:

```html
<main data-surge>
  <button data-action="add">Add new item</button>
  <ul id="list" data-size=1></ul>
</main>
```

```javascript
surge({
  add: $ => $.list.append(`<li>Item number ${$.list.size++}</li>`)
})
```

You can add `id`s and `data-action` attributes to dynamically created HTML to create fully interactive web pages.

**See the To Do List example below for this in action**

### `$.element.prepend`

The `prepend` method works in the same was as `append` but inserts the HTML fragment as the first child of the element.

### `$.element.after`

The `after` method will insert the HTML fragment after the element (as a sibling).

### `$.element.before`

The `before` method will insert the HTML fragment before the element (as a sibling).

### `$.element.replace`

The `replace` method will replace the element with the HTML fragment.

# State Management

State can be managed at an element level by using `data` attribues. These can be used to set properties of the element that can be accessed using the Surge object. For example, you can keep track of whether an item is important or not:

```html
<h1 id="heading" data-important=true data-action'="click->highlight">Something Important</h1>
```

This can then be accessed in the action code:

```javascript
highlight: $ => {
  if($("#heading).important){
    $("#heading).style.color = "red"
  } else {
    $("#heading).style.color = "yellow"
  }
}
```

The Surge object, `$`, is effectively a global object of the app and is available to every action, so is perfect for managing shared state that you want to share around the whole app.

You can add properites directly to the Surge object using the dot notation:

```
$.username = "Ada"
```

This will now be accessible in all of the actions.

If you are using a lot of properties in this way, it might be worth namespacing these values:

```
$.state.username = "Ada"
```

The key thing to remember is that the Surge object acts just like a regular object and is available in every action.

**See the Stopwatch example for this technique being used to keep track of whether the clock is ticking**
